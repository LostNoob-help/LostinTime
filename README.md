# Lost in Time

The Roblox game I am making for fun and making money will take players on an epic adventure through different eras. Players will explore ancient civilizations, futuristic cities, and mythical lands, each with its unique challenges and quests.

## Game Features

1. **Diverse Worlds**: Each era will have its own setting, from the Roman Empire to a cyberpunk future. Players can unlock new time periods as they progress.

2. **Character Customization**: Players can create and customize their avatars with various outfits and accessories that match the themes of each time period.

3. **Quests and Challenges**: Special quests will allow players to earn unique rewards and collectibles. Expect puzzles, battles, and historical trivia!

4. **Multiplayer Interaction**: Team up with friends or compete against others to see who can complete challenges the fastest.

5. **In-Game Economy**: Players can earn virtual currency through gameplay, which they can use to purchase items or special abilities within the game.

## Development Process

I’m currently in the development phase, working on the game mechanics and design. I’m using Roblox Studio to bring my vision to life, incorporating feedback from playtests to ensure a fun experience for everyone.

## Monetization

While I'm making this game for fun, I also plan to implement microtransactions for cosmetic items and exclusive content. This way, players can enjoy the game while helping support its ongoing development.

## Conclusion

I'm excited about the journey of creating "Lost in Time" and look forward to sharing it with players soon! I hope it becomes a beloved game that sparks creativity and adventure in everyone who plays it. Stay tuned for updates!
